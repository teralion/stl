Inserts a new element in the multimap. This new element is constructed in place using args as the arguments for the construction of a value_type (which is an object of a pair type).

This effectively increases the container size by one.

Internally, multimap containers keep all their elements sorted by key following the criterion specified by its comparison object. The element is always inserted in its respective position following this ordering.

The element is constructed in-place by calling allocator_traits::construct with args forwarded.

A similar member function exists, insert, which either copies or moves existing objects into the container.

The relative ordering of elements with equivalent keys is preserved, and newly inserted elements follow those with equivalent keys already in the container.
